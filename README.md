#### Core Application
This application was built with React, Redux, and Material UI.
Things to note:
1. Authentication should persist, using local storage for now
2. The application data does not currently persist because of data from a mocked backend service, however next steps would be to create an actual DB with persistent data
3. Routing was wired up through react-router-dom
